		"post_description": "When I first got the news that I’d been accepted into the summer internship program at JAIST in Japan, I wasn’t overjoyed. I knew that I’d get to learn a lot by working with the Maezono group and that I was really lucky to get a chance to go abroad, but I just didn’t want to go to Japan. I’d heard that the food was terrible, communication was difficult as people don’t understand English, and that a culture of over-work kills people every day.\n\nTwo months in Japan completely changed my perception.\n\nThe food was delicious – even cafeteria food was amazing. (Disclaimer: I’m not a vegetarian). I developed a taste for bento and sushi and learned how to eat using chopsticks. Sure, people didn’t understand more than a few words of English, but they were very friendly, polite and extremely helpful, and most importantly, willing to put in efforts to communicate. The lab I worked in had no strict rules about time – I could come and go whenever I wanted to – as long as I got my work done. We weren’t expected to come on weekends and holidays. Getting around was easy; public transport was reliable and safe. And there was always something exciting to do every weekend!\n\nJAIST is located in a small town called Nomi, around 20 kilometers away from the city of Kanazawa – known for the famous Kenrokuen gardens. It’s a really quiet place, surrounded by gentle hills and forests. You can grab a bike and explore the countryside (I did) – just beware of the bears and wild boars!\n\nI worked on benchmarking performance of accelerated Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on a high-bandwidth HPC cluster. DFT is a technique used for ab-initio electronic structure calculations. Force constants obtained from DFT can be used for lattice dynamics (phonon) calculations.\n\nFirst, I learned about the basics of DFT. I learned how to perform electronic structure calculations using Quantum Espresso and phonon calculations using Phonopy. Next, I chose my project, and figured out a work plan with my co-mentor, a graduate student from China. I worked on scaling up a cluster, and setting it up with HPC network fabric. From then onwards, I performed various test calculations, varying different parameters and parallelization options, and profiling performance – in the search for good benchmarks. The calculations were big and time consuming, running for hours at a stretch. I got correct results only towards the end of my internship.\n\nWeekends were always fun. After working 5 days a week, my friends and I found out great ways to unwind. We explored the nearby city of Komatsu on cycle, spent a day by the seashore, visited many shinto shrines and a beautiful sky park in Tsurugi, and trekked to a nearby waterfall. We explored Kanazawa, spending time at the beautiful Kenrokuen gardens and the majestic Kanazawa castle. We learned about kutani ceramic-making through a guided tour, and learned how to paint them.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most, however, were trips to Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo.\n\nKyoto – the former imperial capital of Japan for one thousand years – has many historical sites to explore. We went to the Arashiyama bamboo forest, the Kinkaku-ji temple, Kiyomizu-dera, the Imperial Palace, and to Fushimi-Inari Taisha.\n\nDotonbori – famous for its bright neon lights and delicious okonomiyaki and takoyaki – was the highlight of our stay in Osaka.\n\nWe travelled from Kanazawa to Tokyo by the Shinkansen (Japan’s famous high speed railway). There was a lot to see in Tokyo. We went up to floor 350 of the Tokyo Skytree (the world’s second-tallest man-made structure). We explored Akihabara (famous for Manga and electronics), Shinjuku (famous for night-life), Roppongi, Shibuya, and Asakusa. We stayed in a capsule hotel – a novel experience I’ll never forget. We got around using Tokyo’s infamously punctual (and crowded) Metro, and walked from our Airbnb apartment to Tokyo Tower and back in the wee hours of the night.\n\nDuring the last two weeks of my stay, I got an opportunity to teach at the Sakura workshop. I took hands-on sessions on shell scripting, networking, and parallel Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and DFT calculations. Undergraduates from Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and India attended the workshop. I spent time with them – and made friends. We ate sushi together and explored the streets of Kanazawa over the weekend.\n\nI learned a lot during my internship. While preparing for it, I learned parallel programming, and realized that it’s challenging and fun. At JAIST, I realized that modelling and simulation and solid-state physics can be very interesting. After I got back, I decided to further explore related fields, and learned basic statistical mechanics, Monte-Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations through a project, and wrote code too. During my winter break, I learned the basics of solid-state physics in detail, and got back to DFT to understand it better.\n\nI have realized what I want to do in the future. I wish to pursue graduate studies with research focused on condensed matter modelling and simulation. I now have a much clearer idea of my goals, and what I need to study to achieve them.\n\nThe best part is - I had lots of fun!\n\nTwo months before the day I left Japan, I didn’t want to go there.\n\nNow, I can’t wait for the chance to go again.",

		"post_description": "After the end of a busy 2015, it was a start to new year with ambitious desires and lots of expectations. It was 1st of January when I had my first interview for the internship selection at one of the foreign universities called State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo in the United States. It was going to be a tough interview as there were several of my batchmates who had better profile suited for that internship, were also going to sit in the interview. Just to give a brief idea about how they had a better profile than me, I spent my previous summers doing things not related to academics. I went for Explorer Fellowship in the summer of 2016 and did some institute building work in summer of 2015. So basically, I haven’t done any projects or some related work apart from the routine courses, which most of the other people sitting for the interview had done. The interviews were over and I was somehow convinced based on the interview that it would be difficult for me to get a foreign internship given my CGPA and profile.\n\nAs the semester progressed, the internship opportunities would be floated as and when they arrived. I knew that if I had to go on foreign internship, I had to go with the contacts of professors whom I know otherwise the chances are thin. So, I contacted Prof. Vimal Mishra, whom I knew since the start of my undergraduate career. I expressed my desire of going for an internship abroad. You might be aware that not every professor is approachable and not everyone would be ready to recommend you to their colleagues, but Prof. Mishra was not one of them. He was always ready to provide opportunities to genuine students. And I would not boast about it, but I would fall into the category of “genuine” student which is why Prof. Mishra was willing to help me.\n\nMeanwhile, there was one internship opportunity at EPFL, Switzerland floated in the institute. Three students including me sat for the interview and two students were selected of which I was not one of them. It was almost March ending and I couldn’t see more of opportunities coming. Now the only option left was Prof. Mishra. Every morning I would be seen waiting for him outside his office, to remind him that he needs to talk to his colleagues for me. This went on for almost one week. Next morning, I woke up and as usual I took my cell phone to check for notifications. To my surprise, there was an email from Prof. Mishra saying “Congrats Prakrut, you are going for an internship!”. There were six other emails in the same thread where Prof. Mishra sent my CV to his colleague Prof. Venkat Lakshmi at University of South Carolina and Prof. Lakshmi confirmed that he wanted to have me as an intern for summer of 2017.\n\nSuddenly, I was all happy and my friends and family flooded my social media accounts with wishes. All the necessary procedures for Institute, VISA process and the documentation from University of South Carolina(UofSC) was completed just on time. Unlike my other batchmates, who were going in groups of at least 2-3 people, I was all alone. Twenty-nine hours of flight journey to the States, two months of stay and again twenty-nine hours of return flight back to India, started to daunt me as I had to stay alone and manage everything. I was fortunate enough to get a room in an apartment close to the department with Indian roommates. UofSC is located in the city of Columbia which is the capital of South Carolina. Columbia is a second-tier city with quite decent transport and life gets harder for people who don’t own a car – which was the case with me.\n\nTwo days after reaching Columbia, I was still suffering from the jet lag and luckily Prof. Lakshmi gave me a week’s time to get acquainted with the place and complete the official processes with International Student office at UofSC. My first meeting with Prof. Lakshmi was after roughly two weeks from the time I reached there. Venkat Lakshmi, a man with a smiling face all the time – Each person in the building would know that Venkat (as he preferred to be called) is here when he was around. In the very first meeting, he told me that first thing you should do while your stay here is – Enjoy! Go to the park and work. Don’t just sit in this closed shitty rooms whole day. So that was the first impression of the American way of doing work – at least that’s what I concluded from it. While Prof. Lakshmi was away, I worked with his research group i.e. Ph.D. students and Postdoc students. Most of the things that I learned was by discussing with those people, each of whom would have their own way of working and had different research interests.\n\n‘IITian’ – This is the thing which made me feel proud out there. Those Ph.D. and postdoc students might be good at research which I will eventually be after the experience, but being an IITian, you can be good at what you want to; which is not the case with the rest of the bunch. All this boasting of IITian is because the students were not good at coding or the data analysis part and as usual IITian, I knew some basics on which I worked upon. Those students were fascinated by this and they asked me to teach them Python – one of the computer programming languages used for data analysis. I happily agreed on that. So now, my normal routine would look somewhat like this – 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM:- My own internship work; 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM:- Teaching Python to them.\n\nOne month into the internship and I was just able to finalize the topic on which I would be working on. As Prof. Lakshmi would say – “Have a clear plan on what to do and rest would be an easy task.” I worked on the topic of ‘Evolution of groundwater resources in response to pumping, land-use change and rainfall in India’. It was basically studying the patterns of changes in groundwater storage levels affected by changes in different parameters using satellite data.\n\nOverall, I am proud of what I did in those two months of the summers of 2017. I went on to continue the same work here back at IIT Gandhinagar and was able to present this work at the conference – AGU Fall Meeting which was held in New Orleans in December 2017. Thanks to the Student Travel Grant that I was awarded for presenting my work at the Fall Meeting. And of course, being a teacher of one Ph.D. and two Postdoc students was the cherry on top of it. In the end, it was all possible because of Prof. Vimal Mishra and his confidence in me. I would like to thank him from the bottom of my heart for providing me with this wonderful opportunity.",

		"post_description": "In the summer of 2017, I got an opportunity for a Summer Research Internship at Clemson University, South Carolina, USA. Clemson is a small University town with population of Forty thousand half of which are university students. Founded in 1889, the university is over hundred years old and is ranked in top public universities in the country. The university exhibits a great scale of diversity with rough composition of 30% Chinese, 25% Indian, 20% American, 15% European and 10% rest students in Graduate study programmes. The composition resembles to many other well-known US universities which points out two major things. Firstly, the need of Quality public universities having qualified faculty and world class research facilities in developing countries like India and China. And, secondly, the resistance for higher education in local American society.\n\nI was working in the department of Material Science with Prof. Olga Kuksenok on Hydrogel behaviour under EM waves for applications in Electronic appliances. I was working majorly on computer simulations with a group of six colleagues in the lab. The important difference I found in the was extreme punctuality in time and completion of assigned task compared to India. Even though I was an intern I was supposed to work for regular full-time that is eight hours a day. The people were very serious about there working time of 8 am to 4 pm and, were also keen in availing the weekly holidays for Saturday and Sunday. I was working with a diverse group consisting of Chinese, Ukrainian, English, and Indian student, hence it was informative experience for me to discuss about the educational systems in different parts of the world during our lunch time.\n\nApart from this, the one striking difference between Indian town and town in America is the infrastructure. The infrastructure includes the road and footpath conditions, town planning, the quality of houses and the availability of well-known clothing brands and food-chains in and around the town. Another noticeable thing is the number of car owners even in small town like Clemson. On an average over 90% of local families own at least one four-wheeler and over 70% of native undergraduates owns their own vehicle which is very different from situation in India. Other than the cheap availability of vehicle and fuel in USA, the structural design of supermarkets like Walmart and drive-in facility at food chains like MacDonald’s makes it very comfortable for car owners to fulfil there daily needs. With the limited local transport facility by government shuttles in the towns other than Metropolitans, a personal vehicle has been an integral part of the lifestyle of Americans. In general people found to be more health conscious (or one could say Calorie conscious) which I think because of two main reasons. One is the development of country which brought awareness and the other is the American food which largely contains Bread, Sugar, and Meat which forces people to keep track of calorie intake.\n\nUnlike many Asian countries, the labour cost in America is very high which has made people perform their daily tasks on their own instead of being dependent on some maid. People easily do the tasks like Plumbing, fixing a car or building a small component in their house which sometimes come from individuals interest but more often it is driven by the economic need. As mentioned earlier regarding the availability of infrastructure in small towns, this has impacted on the need of youth (or general people) to rush towards metropolitan cities. This lower rate of migration really helps in controlling the demand of resources in big cities and indeed helps in developing local economy as the local talent works in the locality. This is one of the major issues in developing countries like India and China who also suffer from there huge population and unavailability of infrastructure.\n\nGeographically South Carolina is part of the southern states in USA which are assumed to be conservative than the other parts of the country. The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average in this part of the country1. During my short experience of three months, I met with few of my local friends in the neighborhood who regularly used to volunteer for Sunday prayers and schools in the Baptist church which fits with the impression of Southerners. Given all of these, I found the people to be helping and social since we had few Potlucks and weekend trips with the neighbors. Hence, to conclude, one can see the difference between the economic condition and social school of thoughts for people in developed and developing countries.",

It was a small town but it was very beautiful and offered a perfect environment for doing research. It was heavily student centric since about 25% of the population were students. Personally I did not face any problems in adjusting to life over there since everything was very well organised. The public transport was excellent and even the Mensas were very well placed across the city. Everything was very easily accessible and there were no problems with travel within the city.\n\nI was initially worried about going to a country which spoke a completely different language and had a different culture than what I was brought up in. However, I found out that there was no need to worry. The people I was working with were very warm and welcoming. There was no such language barrier that I had imagined since everyone spoke English. Of course, outside of work I did face some issues with communicating with other people, but they were not so serious. I got my city registration work done without any problems and day to day activities such as shopping, eating out etc. were also not a problem.\n\nI also travelled quite a lot and I felt that this experience gave me a lot of confidence in terms of being able to live anywhere on my own. I felt that I matured a lot during this internship since for the first time in my life I had to cook for myself and manage my money. Meeting different people was also a great experience and I really appreciated the cultural diversity that I could find in Germany. I was able to make a lot of new friends and learn about different cultures and places.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience and I feel that being in a different lab environment really helped me strengthen my knowledge in my field of interest. My internship was very hands-on and required an equal amount of experimental and simulation based work. I felt that it really helped me understand the experimental process better since I explored both sides of the work. The lab environment was very nice in the sense that there was no stress or competition. Everybody helped each other a lot and the scientific collaboration that occurred benefited everyone. My PhD guide helped me a lot when I first started and I was able to learn a lot of new things.\n\nMy professor was quite happy with what I had accomplished in 3 months and agreed to support me in my future endeavours. He was a great person to work with and I interacted with him on a daily basis which was very productive for my internship. After doing this internship, I feel much more confident in pursuing a career in research.",
