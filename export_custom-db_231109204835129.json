				"post_description": "Kindly provide a comprehensive explanation of the research problems currently being\naddressed by you and your research group. Additionally, please elucidate how your\ngroup's research will impact individuals' day-to-day lives in the future from a layman's\nperspective. Furthermore, could you share examples of successful real-world\napplications where the machine learning algorithms you have developed or researched\nhave been implemented, leveraging your expertise in Machine Learning?\nOur group called the sustainability group, works on applications pertaining to energy, air quality\nand health. We mostly work on machine learning problems with uncertainty. Here is a flavour of\nthe kind of work we do.\nAir quality: A significant proportion of the Indian (and global) population is exposed to severe air\npollution leading to several diseases and loss of life. We can not reduce what we can not\naccurately measure. However, the number of air quality measurement stations is significantly\nlower than the required numbers. Our work develops Bayesian machine learning methods to\naccurately estimate air quality at locations without any sensors. Importantly, we focus on not\nonly providing the predicted air quality at a location but also uncertainty estimates. We then\nleverage this uncertainty to recommend where to install the next set of stations (also called\nactive learning) to improve the predictive performance of our models.\nHealth: The Apple Watch and similar wearables such as portable diabetes machines and\noxygen saturation monitors have revolutionised healthcare. We look at creating similar\nwearables for estimating lung function and calorie count. We developed a mask-based system\ncalled SpiroMask that can accurately estimate various lung health parameters using an\ninexpensive system sitting at home, which earlier required a visit to a clinic. Similarly, we are\npresently developing a thermal camera-based system to accurately estimate calorie burn while\nexercising. Interestingly, this system is up to 25% more accurate than the Apple Watch.\nWorking on such healthcare applications and building applications and machine learning models\nis generally hard due to the lack of participant data. We again leverage active learning to\nstrategically recruit participants. We have found that by using our methods, we can significantly\nlower the effort required to recruit participants.\nEnergy: Buildings across the world consume roughly one-third of the total energy expenditure.\nOne way to reduce this energy is by providing occupants with feedback on their per-appliance\nenergy usage. This has been shown to reduce energy expenditure by up to 15%. But, we can\nnot install a sensor per appliance as it scales poorly in cost and maintenance effort. We\nproposed techniques to disaggregate the total energy consumption (measured at the household\nlevel using a smart meter) via machine learning into the energy consumption of constituent\nappliances.\nHow do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in\nrapidly progressing research work?\n\nBeing a faculty is a very rewarding experience. I have always maintained that the best way to\nlearn is by teaching. Thus, this is one job that guarantees that one can keep improving and\nlearning. This role gives us the opportunity to positively impact the lives of students (future\nleaders!). Being a faculty also allows us to pursue research directions that we find impactful and\ninteresting.\nHow do you stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends in the field of\nmachine learning algorithms? Are there any particular conferences, journals, or online\nresources you find valuable and would suggest to the readers?\nThe pace of innovation in our field and times is indeed hard to keep up to pace with. I spend\ndedicated time (~1-2 hours) daily morning studying some interesting machine learning\ntalks/lectures (mostly YouTube) and then implementing them on my research blog. This helps\nme keep in touch with the theory and implementation aspects of these algorithms. Teaching\ncourses and keeping the courses relevant and updated also helps me in this regard. Like other\nacademics, I have also identified a subset of conferences in my field that I follow. To scale the\nlearning, attending group seminars, faculty talks, and similar events is a must!",

				"post_description": "I am Yash Hiren More, a senior undergraduate student in the Computer Science &\nEngineering program at IIT Gandhinagar. I come from Palghar, Maharashtra, and I am\npursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and engineering alongside my major\nin Electrical Engineering for my BTech degree at IIT Gandhinagar. My academic focus\ncentres around algorithms, specifically Parameterized Complexity and Computational\nSocial Choice. I cherish quality moments spent with friends and family during my leisure\ntime. Additionally, I am deeply passionate about game development and online gaming,\nwith frequent indulgence in a game called League of Legends. This enthusiasm led my\nteam to secure a silver medal for game development at last year's Inter IIT Tech Meet,\nfurther fueling my dedication to excel in this realm.\nWhile at the Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, I was engaged in a\ncaptivating realm of parameterised complexity and computational social choice. This\nfield explores the convergence of computer science and collective decision-making,\nparticularly investigating the challenges computers face in solving various group\ndecisions within specific contexts. Despite the ‘complexity', I embraced this internship\nwholeheartedly, collaborating with postdoctoral researchers under Prof. Saket\nSaurabh's guidance. My research was centred on comprehending the computational\ncomplexity in a liquid democracy setting under classical as well as parameterised\nscenarios, illuminating the interplay between computational efficiency and social preferences.\n\nAbout my experiences in Bergen, which is considered the capital of Parameterized\nComplexity I was fortunate enough to meet elite Prof. Mike Fellows who is considered\nas the founder of this field. I carried my handy whiteboard to Norway.\nSeeing my ideas turn into results on the whiteboard was like creating something from\nscratch and feeling excited about it. PS: I was lucky to see the Aurora Borealis as well\n;).\nCultivating a solid foundation is paramount for those aspiring to venture into computer\nscience research. This involves extensive reading, dedicated work, and a clear grasp of\nconcepts like NP-completeness. Focus on getting actual results, and don't be afraid of\nmistakes – they're great chances to learn. Many times you’ll come across situations\nwhere you put in endless efforts but get absolutely no results. Research is about\nunderstanding and embracing this. There is an article by Matthew Might titled, \"An\nIllustrated guide to a Ph.D\", which I recommend everyone pursuing research to read\nonce. Collaboration and seeking guidance from peers and mentors are essential for\ngrowth. Stay curious, participate in conferences, and remain updated with the latest\nadvancements while adhering to ethical standards. Remember, perseverance is\n\ncritical—each obstacle surmounted brings you closer to leaving a meaningful impact on\nthe future of computer science.\nMy adventure in theoretical computer science has been a mix of curiosity and discovery.\nI've learned you can create something unique by trying and staying curious. As I move\nforward, I'm excited to keep exploring and learning, and I hope my story inspires others\nto do the same.",

				"post_description": "Energy, Environment, and Exposure Laboratory (EEEL)\n\nPI: Sameer Patel, Assitant Professor, Jointly Appointed in Department of Civil Engineering and\n\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering\n\nOur research group at the Energy, Environment, and Exposure Laboratory (EEEL) conducts\ninterdisciplinary research on various aspects of energy, environment, and human exposure. Since\nenergy, environment, and human exposure are not independent, we aim to understand their\ncomplex interdependency. Fundamental insights from our work are used to develop solutions for\nmitigating the health impacts of air pollution while optimizing the associated energy penalty.\n\nSeven million global deaths are attributed to air pollution annually, of which indoor air pollution\n(IAP) is a significant contributor. People, on average, spend 80-90% of their time in some kind\nof built environment, such as homes, offices, and automobiles. Therefore, exposure occurring in\nindoor environments might dominate that outdoors. However, air pollution researchers,\npolicymakers, and media primarily focus on outdoor or ambient pollution in India. Our research\ngroup does interdisciplinary research on different aspects of air pollution, including\nmeasurements, modeling, and mitigation. Experimental and computational studies help us\nunderstand the sources, transport, transformation, and fate of air pollutants in indoor spaces. We\nthen use the gained fundamental understanding to develop mitigation strategies to protect human\nhealth. In addition, we also design and develop low-cost air quality monitors for real-time\nmeasurements.\n\nWe also investigate how our air pollution mitigation strategies will affect the energy\nconsumption of buildings because there is usually a tradeoff between energy consumption and air\nquality. This field of research is even more critical in India as we are constructing buildings\nfastest globally, and energy consumption of buildings is bound to be the biggest chunk of the\nnation’s total energy consumption, as is the case in many developed nations. Physics-based\n\nmodeling-based dynamic optimization strategies are evaluated in our laboratory to assess the\ntradeoff between energy consumption, air quality, and thermal comfort.\n\nAnother critical aspect is to help policymakers and regulators develop a framework for\nrecommending guidelines for air quality in different built environments. Indoor air quality\nregulations and guidelines are limited in India and globally. Multi-faceted research on pollutants,\nexposure, health impacts, and commercially available mitigation technology by my research\ngroup enable relevant stakeholders to develop practical guidelines and regulations. Further,\nbuildings have been given green certificates by different rating agencies. However, the building\nrating methodologies lack scientific robustness and are static in nature. Moreover, indoor air\nquality, which governs the health of its occupants, is given no to minimal weightage. The high\nweightage given to energy consumption indirectly de-incentivizes measures for good indoor\nquality, as air pollution mitigation strategies usually lead to higher energy consumption. To\naddress this major flaw in assessing and rating buildings, my research group also works on\ndeveloping a holistic understanding of building sustainability while accounting for tradeoffs\nbetween human health, human comfort, and energy consumption.",

				"post_description": "Quill : August Edition (Alumni Feature : Mr.Nikhil Roy)\n1)Please tell us a bit about yourself, your background, and your journey from IIT\nGandhinagar to where you are now.\nAns) I come from Thane, India. In 2018, I completed my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering\nfrom IIT Gandhinagar. Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued further education\nat the University of Florida, where I obtained a master's degree in Chemical Engineering\nin 2020.\nDuring my time at the University of Florida, I engaged in three internships. The first was\nat a petroleum/polymers company called SABIC, and the subsequent two were at a\nsemiconductors company named Micron.\nPresently, I am employed as a Research & Development engineer at Micron's\nheadquarters in Boise, Idaho. However, I am currently stationed at Micron's Singapore\nsite for a temporary work assignment.\n\n2)How did your time at IIT Gandhinagar shape your values, skills, and overall outlook\non life and career?\nAns)I consider myself lucky to have secured an AIR of 4500-5000, which led me to IIT\nGandhinagar, instead of one of the older IITs. Looking back, my time at IIT GN was\nundeniably the most enriching and enjoyable four years of my life. The college went\nabove and beyond to take care of its students, providing excellent facilities such as\nwell-furnished rooms, liberal hostel rules, and financial aid. Moreover, the institution's\napproach to education introduced us to a vast world beyond mere rote learning and\nacademics, broadening our perspectives.\nThroughout my journey at IITGN, I witnessed remarkable transformations in many of my\nbatchmates, who matured and grew during their time at IITGN. One of the standout\nfeatures of our college was its flexibility in terms of branch change, enabling students to\nexplore different interests and excel in various electives. Even if your AIR rank was not\ngreat, the right choice of electives and self-learning could open doors to a core CS role\nfor a chemical engineer.\nMy journey at IITGN was made even more exciting by the opportunities to embark on\nthree foreign internships in the US, Japan, and Singapore. These experiences played a\ncrucial role in shaping my desire to pursue an MS abroad. The final two years of my\n\ncollege life proved to be the most valuable, as I honed my leadership skills while serving\nas the General Secretary, AIChE president, Class Representative and Shastrath Socratic\nSociety secretary.\nIIT Gandhinagar provided me with an exceptional education and a platform to grow both\nacademically and personally. I am truly grateful for the memories and experiences that\nhave shaped my path ahead.\n\n3)As the General Secretary and President of Alche, could you share some of your most\nmemorable experiences and achievements during your leadership roles?\nAns) Throughout our time on the student council, one of our achievements was\ninitiating the first-ever inter-IIT student leadership conclave. We made it a priority to be\napproachable and student-friendly, and I take great pride in the fact that our student\ncouncil was successful in achieving that.\nDuring my tenure as AICHE president, we took a step forward by creating the inaugural\nprototype of Chem-E-Car, which went on to compete in various inter-college events. It\nwas an exciting and rewarding experience to witness our efforts come to life in such a\ntangible way.\n\n4)Students often struggle with choosing the right career path. How did you approach\nthis decision? Was it a process of trial and error, or did you always know you wanted to\npursue a career in your field of study?\nAns) To be honest, it was all about trial and error for me. In my opinion, the primary goal\nshould be to seek exposure and gather knowledge about various career possibilities,\nwhether it's entrepreneurship, core jobs, finance roles, or pursuing higher studies. At this\nstage of my career, I am still in the early phases, and I believe it's a journey that spans\nseveral decades, allowing room for trial and error.\nHaving a clear career path right from the start is fantastic, but even if you don't, don't\nworry. The early years of your career offer ample opportunities to learn, explore, and\nadapt. Think of it as a marathon, not a do-or-die situation. Embrace the learning process,\ntry different paths, and make adjustments along the way. It's all part of the journey\ntowards building a fulfilling and successful career.\n\n5)Achieving excellent TOEFL and GRE scores must have been quite an\naccomplishment. Could you share some tips and strategies for achieving high scores\nin these exams?\nAns) I enrolled in Magoosh courses and dedicated time to practicing full-length tests\nmultiple times. In fact, I recommend considering taking the GRE/TOEFL exams during\nyour third year of study to get a head start in the application process. However, it's\nimportant to keep in mind that GRE/TOEFL scores are primarily for gaining admission to\na specific college, and their significance diminishes afterward.\nIn the grand scheme of things, a slight difference in scores, like 315 vs. 330, won't have\na significant impact. Instead, I encourage you to focus on optimizing other critical\naspects of your admission package, such as strong Letters of Recommendation (LORs),\nwell-crafted Statements of Purpose (SOPs), notable projects, and impactful internships.\nThese elements carry substantial weight in your application and can greatly enhance\nyour chances of admission, beyond just relying on GRE scores.\n\n6)How did you decide to pursue a Master's degree, and why did you choose the\nUniversity of Florida for your further studies?What were the major differences between\nthe culture at IITGN and UF?\nAns) Both IITGN and UF are excellent places. They both offer flexibility in terms of\nelective courses, internships and provide ample opportunities for engaging in\nextracurricular activities. In my case, I decided to attend UF primarily because I was\nawarded a significant scholarship, which made it a financially convenient option.\nDuring your final year, there might be a tendency among students to feel pressured to\nsecure admission to top Ivy League colleges. However, in my personal opinion,\nparticularly concerning pursuing a Master's degree (I cannot comment on PhDs), the\ndisparity between attending a US rank #10 college versus a US rank #90 college won't\nsignificantly impact your long-term career prospects. Hence, I opted for UF, which is a\nreputable college, and the scholarship simplified the financial part, making it a more\npractical choice for me.\n\n7)What opportunities did your Master's degree open up for you professionally? How\ndid it contribute to your career growth and aspirations?\nAns) During my Master's program, I was exposed to the world of semiconductors. This\nindustry is highly specialized, and only a few developed countries possess the expertise\n\nand resources required to manufacture advanced chips. Hopefully, India will be a\nsemiconductor powerhouse in the near future.\nAt UF, I had access to a cleanroom facility where I had the opportunity to work on\nlab courses and fabricate semiconductor devices. My experience at UF played a pivotal\nrole in opening doors for me within the semiconductor industry and our IIT alumni\nhelped me land my foot in the door. Presently, I am actively engaged in this field and\nenjoying my work in this exciting and cutting-edge domain.\n8)Based on your experiences and successes, what advice would you give to current\nstudents and upcoming graduates as they navigate their academic and professional\njourneys?\nAns) Embrace your time at IITGN and seize every opportunity to enhance your soft\nskills. Learn the art of networking and engaging in conversations with people from\ndiverse countries and cultures. Take inspiration from skilled individuals like Atul Singh to\nrefine your writing abilities and excel in communication.\nSeek out experiences that offer valuable exposure, such as international internships,\ninvolvement in startups, engaging in research projects, and exploring a wide range of\nextracurricular activities. Each of these experiences will contribute significantly to your\npersonal and professional growth, enriching your journey at IITGN and beyond.",

				"post_description": "**Q. Can you please explain elaborately the research problems currently being addressed by you and your group? Looking from Lyman's perspective, how will your group's research effect a person's day to day life in the future? How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work?**\n\nWhenever I think of the trajectory of cutting-edge Materials research, I am reminded of the famous motto of the Olympics, “Citius, Altius, Fortius” that encourages Olympians to aim for faster, higher and stronger performance. Materials development has been one of the best yardsticks of technological progress attested to by the naming of civilizational ages starting from the prehistoric stone age times, to bronze, iron, steel ages, and what we now call the silicon age. If one observes keenly, one can easily perceive that we have always tried to make our materials stronger, lighter, and simply, better in every conceivable way. Indeed, this pursuit has only progressed at breakneck speed in the 21st century, driven by a plethora of variables such as consumerism, defense and military applications, medical applications, etc., to name a few. In fact, the addition of a fourth word, “Communiter”, to the Olympics motto in 2021 that emphasizes togetherness is even more apt for Materials research - we want materials to have all the desirable properties together, or at the same time!\n\nAt the Computational Molecular Engineering Group (CMEG) at IITGN, we work on advanced simulations of material structure, properties and design, with a view to understanding the complex relationships between them. These simulations make use of realistic descriptions of material interactions across various length and time scales, and when combined with appropriate input conditions and computational resources to run them on (mind you, simulating materials at the nanoscale (that is, a time scale of 1 nanosecond and a length scale of 1 nanometer may well take over several days!), yield an unprecedented level of detail that cannot be achieved through experimentation. This naturally accelerates the discovery, design and development of novel materials and is crucial for the success of programs such as the Materials Genome Initiative.\n\nI will highlight some of our ongoing projects briefly. The first is perhaps one of the oldest fields of Materials, alloy development. Here, we model novel, multi-component alloys (made up of several alloying additions) with a range of material defects and elucidate the role played by these defects on the mechanical properties of the alloy. We make use of state-of-the-art atomistic simulations and machine learning techniques to describe the interaction of the atoms and defects and to explain the mechanisms responsible for their observed properties. This has important implications for high-strength, high-toughness materials with applications in defense, aerospace and structural components. The second project looks into mechanisms of Lithium diffusion in modern Lithium ion batteries from the lens of computational materials science. To ensure optimum performance and safety of the battery, there has been an exciting push internationally to develop novel battery materials with superior properties and our group is pursuing some fundamental research in this direction. Thirdly, a focus of our group is to engineer materials that are inspired by nature, a field known as biomimetics. To give some perspective, natural materials such as spider silk, nacre (the inner lining of an oyster shell), bone, gecko’s feet, etc. have fascinating properties such as exceptional specific strength, toughness, adhesive properties and the like. We build atomistic models of these materials to understand the interplay between the structure and property that are helping us in predicting new design rules and eventually, development and deployment of these materials for various applications.\n\nFinally, being a Professor has been immensely beneficial to me personally in several respects and I am sure all faculty members share this sentiment. Working on cutting-edge research projects broadens one’s understanding of our world and gives us a lot of food for thought in this complex and intricate world that we live in. The joy of teaching is another very important aspect that cannot be put into words. Although it can definitely be daunting to keep pace with rapidly changing theories, ideas and methodologies, striking a good balance between research, teaching and other forms of service is a truly rewarding, but most importantly, a humbling experience.",

Additionally, please elucidate how your\ngroup's research will impact individuals' day-to-day lives in the future from a layman's\nperspective. Furthermore, could you share examples of successful real-world\napplications where the machine learning algorithms you have developed or researched\nhave been implemented, leveraging your expertise in Machine Learning?_\n\nOur group called the sustainability group, works on applications pertaining to energy, air quality\nand health. We mostly work on machine learning problems with uncertainty. Here is a flavour of\nthe kind of work we do.\nAir quality: A significant proportion of the Indian (and global) population is exposed to severe air\npollution leading to several diseases and loss of life. We can not reduce what we can not\naccurately measure. However, the number of air quality measurement stations is significantly\nlower than the required numbers. Our work develops Bayesian machine learning methods to\naccurately estimate air quality at locations without any sensors. Importantly, we focus on not\nonly providing the predicted air quality at a location but also uncertainty estimates. We then\nleverage this uncertainty to recommend where to install the next set of stations (also called\nactive learning) to improve the predictive performance of our models.\nHealth: The Apple Watch and similar wearables such as portable diabetes machines and\noxygen saturation monitors have revolutionised healthcare. We look at creating similar\nwearables for estimating lung function and calorie count. We developed a mask-based system\ncalled SpiroMask that can accurately estimate various lung health parameters using an\ninexpensive system sitting at home, which earlier required a visit to a clinic. Similarly, we are\npresently developing a thermal camera-based system to accurately estimate calorie burn while\nexercising. Interestingly, this system is up to 25% more accurate than the Apple Watch.\nWorking on such healthcare applications and building applications and machine learning models\nis generally hard due to the lack of participant data. We again leverage active learning to\nstrategically recruit participants. We have found that by using our methods, we can significantly\nlower the effort required to recruit participants.\nEnergy: Buildings across the world consume roughly one-third of the total energy expenditure.\nOne way to reduce this energy is by providing occupants with feedback on their per-appliance\nenergy usage. This has been shown to reduce energy expenditure by up to 15%. But, we can\nnot install a sensor per appliance as it scales poorly in cost and maintenance effort. We\nproposed techniques to disaggregate the total energy consumption (measured at the household\nlevel using a smart meter) via machine learning into the energy consumption of constituent\nappliances.\n\n_How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in\nrapidly progressing research work?_\n\nBeing a faculty is a very rewarding experience. I have always maintained that the best way to\nlearn is by teaching. Thus, this is one job that guarantees that one can keep improving and\nlearning. This role gives us the opportunity to positively impact the lives of students (future\nleaders!). Being a faculty also allows us to pursue research directions that we find impactful and\ninteresting.\nHow do you stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends in the field of\nmachine learning algorithms? Are there any particular conferences, journals, or online\nresources you find valuable and would suggest to the readers?\nThe pace of innovation in our field and times is indeed hard to keep up to pace with. I spend\ndedicated time (~1-2 hours) daily morning studying some interesting machine learning\ntalks/lectures (mostly YouTube) and then implementing them on my research blog. This helps\nme keep in touch with the theory and implementation aspects of these algorithms. Teaching\ncourses and keeping the courses relevant and updated also helps me in this regard. Like other\nacademics, I have also identified a subset of conferences in my field that I follow. To scale the\nlearning, attending group seminars, faculty talks, and similar events is a must!",

				"title": "##Invent@IITGN 2019 Experience - Praveen\n",
				"discipline": "Electrical Engineering ",
				"post_description": "Towards the end of my freshman year, early in February 2019, I decided that I wanted to work on something productive during my summer vacations. After a temporarily spiked interest in the Explorers Fellowship succeeding the application deadline, I got to know about Invent@IITGN when I noticed that one of my seniors had a patent in his junior year. Further, when I read about this program, I instantly knew that I wanted to apply for it. Since I was in school, I always had an interest in tearing items apart to observe how everyday objects work. I used to disassemble broken telephones, speakers, etc. and tried to reverse engineer it. Towards the end, I at least turned them on. It was this curious and inquisitive nature of mine that got me excited to join this programme! As a kid, I distinctly remember telling my parents that I wanted to be an \"inventor\" once I grew up, and the programme was a way in which I could let my imagination run wild, and actually \"Invent\" something.\n\n\nIn the first few days of the programme, we formed random teams and constructed a Rube Goldberg machine, and also assembled a massive structure on a wall called \"WonderStructs\". It was a \"find your partner\" activity, as we had to invent our product in teams of two. In the coming weeks, we went from finding a problem to solve to finalizing the problem and solution, to prototyping version 1 using a can of pringles, and to finally finishing our product at prototype version 7.\n\n\nInitially, when we were researching for problems to solve, we had many ideas in mind. However, we came to know that a lot of these already existed, and/or were already products. Invent@IITGN aimed to make something that no one in the world has ever thought. In the beginning, this was exciting but quickly became exhausting. We had over 20 ideas for a new product, but almost all of them were not feasible to be designed within seven weeks. After intense brainstorming, we came up with the idea of creating a device that could help people who couldn't use their hands.\n\n\nThe device that we initially proposed was a robotic arm which would scoop food from a plate and feed it to you. The significant difference between the proposed and other existing arms was that this arm would be driven using some mechanical energy, thus will be entirely mechanical. However, this idea wasn't very well received by our mentors, and we ended up creating a much simpler design which was a vast improvement from other products that existed in the market. Over the seven different prototypes we built, a lot of functionality changed. We eventually managed to reduce the number of moving parts in our design along with reducing the number of electronic components, thus reducing the cost of our device by more than 1000%. Our solution had also made the device portable and user-friendly.\n\n\nWhat was better was the fact that it had a tremendous impact on the global patient market. Millions of people around the world are affected by conditions such as ALS, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Amputations, Surgeries, Genetic disorders, Cerebral Palsy and many more. Almost all of these conditions affect the use of the patients' hand. Therefore, the patient will need the help of a caretaker to perform even basic tasks such as eating, which often leads to a sense of low self-esteem. This is also quite demeaning in a social gathering. FoodBuddy (as we called it) can significantly change their lifestyle and prevent unwanted emotional distress to an already stressed patient. This is achieved by giving back control of the patient's life by easing out the simple task of eating independently.\n\n\nTowards the end of the program, we filled out a provisional patent application. We filed it with the Indian patent office as well as the US patent office. In the coming future, we would like to improve the product further and release the product into the market.\n\n\nDuring these long and exciting seven weeks that I spent in AB 6-202, I had a lot of fun! Apart from actually inventing something, we had a fun activity every weekend. On one of the weeks, we played random games with balloons and paper planes. Another week we went to Ahmedabad to play paintball. During the entire period of Invent@IITGN, I can't forget the virtually unlimited food that all of us were drooling over.\n\n\nI learnt a lot of things by participating at Invent@IITGN. My presentation skills, verbal and written communication skills vastly improved, and I had found myself a large group of friends who have similar interests. Most importantly, I learnt that it is fine to fail. During the programme, we failed several times. From being favourites in one week to being hated another week, I learnt how to fail, and how to bounce back in style.\n\n\nOverall, the entire experience was incredible, and if asked, I would instantly recommend anyone to apply for this programme.\n\n",

				"post_description": "Invent@IIITGN had been a wonderful experience. Can you believe the fact that you can invent something in just six weeks? Yes, you can!  Invent@IITGN is the replication of the Invention Factory run at the Cooper Union, New York under the guidance of Professor Alan Wolf (Physics) and Professor Eric Lima (Mechanical Engineering). It began in India in 2018 with IIT Gandhinagar to be the first institute to host it.  \n\nHere, I share my experience at Invent@IITGN 2019.\n\nWhy did I register for Invent? The three-month-long summer break is the best opportunity for anyone to develop new skills and explore his/her areas of interest by hands-on experimentations. I knew that this time span would  not be utilised efficiently if I were to stay at home. Sometime in February, a mail flashed asking for applications for Invent@IITGN, Summer 2019. The idea of this intensive six-week summer programme is to investigate a real-life problem, and propose and prototype a solution for the same. This very same idea sparked my interest immediately and I applied for the same. Doubtfully, I applied and fortunately, I got selected to be one of the 28 members at Invent@IITGN 2019. \n\nStudents from various IITs such as Bombay, Guwahati, Madras, Palakkad, Dharwad, Dhanbad and Goa took part in the programme along with seven students from IIT Gandhinagar. I had just completed my first year, but students who had completed their second, third and even fourth year were a part of Invent@IITGN.\nInvent is not merely a programme, it is a competition where the best inventors receive decent prize money, where there are groups of two, who work on filing a provisional patent till the journey ends. \n\nSo, here begins the process of ideation, prototyping and pitching. The day one was quite exciting for everyone with many unknown faces all around, everyone with different expectations and interests. The programme began with a basic orientation of a few useful softwares, the 3-D printing and laser cutting machines which we would be using extensively. Our first task was to assemble a miniature Rube Goldberg Machine from a Wonderstruct kit.  It was a fun task which required some coordination and high precision. We were able to assemble the entire structure on the wall by 4 am the next day. Enervated till the end, I thought about whether the programme would be tiring for me. And this was the last time I thought this. Here is a snapshot of the Wonderstruct assembly!\n\n\n \n\nThe professors from Cooper Union, Alan and Eric (as we used to call them) joined us in the first week. They were our mentors along with Prof Madhu, Prof Vineet and Prof Nithin George from IITGN. We were supposed to form our teams in the first week itself. I paired up with Lipika Gupta, a Bachelor of Design student from IIT Guwahati who had just completed her second year. \n\nThe ideation began by forming groups of similar interests and discussing problems relevant to those interests. By the end of the first week, each team had to present their problem and a rudimentary yet unique solution in front of other teams and mentors. The teams with the most convincing ideas would get an upvote, a green signal to go ahead and others were required to either ponder a little more upon defining the problem and solution or change the problem. I’ve noticed that people often jump to solutions while ideating, like matching questions to answers. Definitely, this is not the right approach, a worthy problem will bring up a desirable solution. A tip from my experience: Always look into your surroundings for problems, think about certain difficulties your family and friends might be facing, you are always diligent to solve such problems. \n\nBoth me and my partner were keen on solving certain problems pertaining to the elderly. Initially, we thought of working with wheelchairs and modifying them to make them a little more user-friendly. Another idea was to make a portable ramp as every place is not accessible for wheelchair aided people, but such a product already existed in the market. After spending entirely two days on looking for problems that the elderly or disabled usually face, we realized that there is a very little scope for us to do something in six weeks in this area. With only a day left for our first presentation, we started ideating again from the beginning, thinking of various other problems. \n\nWhile ideating we followed various techniques like SCAMPER and brainstormed to come up with a variety of problems. Sticky notes, empty walls and a notebook always helped in ideating. We finally came up with the idea to organise the medications of the elderly. They often mess up with their medicines and sometimes forget consuming them. An assistant is always required to take care of the medication routines/schedules. Our idea was to come up with an automatic pill dispenser that rings an alarm when medicines are to be taken. The alarm needs to be turned off by the user and that particular dose comes out in a tray. And yeah, we were upvoted!\n\nFor the rest of the weeks, we changed the mechanisms of operating the device, searched for various existing patents (Lipika studied a hell lot of existing patents while I was figuring out how to operate the Arduino!), studied a lot about patent law (thanks to Alan for this), gave presentations to guest panels comprising of professionals working in different areas. This helped us a lot in learning something new or novel every other day. The guest presentations each week helped us in identifying the flaws in our concept and prototype, and it was always enriching to get an expert’s advice on your invention.  Working in a team teaches division of labour, makes you an avid listener and improves your ability in conveying information precisely. It also provides you with new perspectives to think and proceed. \n\nOne fine day, just before Week 3’s guest presentations, we found an existing device similar to ours. Patents can be filed successfully only if the device presents a unique concept or is a non-obvious combination of two or more existing devices. This was a big problem!\nAfter discussing the problem with the mentors, we came up with an idea to monitor the cognitive health of the user along with their medication routine. This made our device more focussed to elderly people suffering from dementia. The cognitive health was monitored by a simple task which the user had to perform every time to get the medicines. We did not find a single existing device monitoring a person’s cognitive health at home!\n\nAlong with improving technical skills, Invent helped me in developing technical writing skills and presentation skills. Your invention might be very useful for society, but unless you convey the essence of your invention to the person in front of you, which might be through words, it is worthless. We significantly improved our speech rate, and I especially learned how to convey information in a minimum number of words. You significantly improve your ability to converse. You learn Jugaad!\n\n\nThis is something Lipika always insisted while making a dummy prototype. Look around and identify how any material, any object can help you in your prototype. Grab it, try it and test it. \n\nApart from the invention, we did a hell lot of fun with all of these little known faces. Every weekend we did something recreational. Once there was a movie evening followed by pizzas, and we sane people ended up watching Deadpool. On another weekend we went out for a paintball game which was an unforgettable experience. There was a Gala Dinner in which many guest evaluators and people from different domains were invited for you to connect with. On one of the weekends, Eric organised recreational competitions for us. \n\nRobokits was our new general store. Apart from everything, we were engaged in a lot of networking. People from different IITs brought their culture, ideas and experiences for a competition worth to give learnings for a lifetime. Invent was amazing and I would recommend it resolutely. \n\n",

				"post_description": "Why did I choose Invent@IITGN?\n\nI came to know about Invent through a senior’s profile where I noticed that he had filed a provisional patent application for an invention through this program. I explored more and got interested to take part in this program. Making things has always been one of my interests. Invent@IITGN was an excellent opportunity to take that interest to a higher level. That is the prime reason why I chose to apply for Invent@IITGN instead of the Explorer’s Fellowship.\n\nAnother thing that inspired me to apply for it was videos of the inventions from previous editions. Invent@IITGN has paved the way for some innovative inventions like an anti-tremor spoon for people with essential tremor, an origami-inspired spill-resistant cup and more.\n\nThe most exciting part was that we could file a provisional patent application through the event. IIT Gandhinagar may later fund the entire non-provisional patent application procedure if it seems worth it. \n\nWhat did I try to invent?\n\nMy teammate Praveen and I invented an assistive dining device that helps people without operable arms to eat food. It scoops food from a plate and lifts it to the user’s mouth. It uses less components than other motorized devices in the market that serve the same purpose. We were able to reduce the number of motors by using slots on the device to direct the spoon as we required. We also made it voice-enabled and reduced its size to that of a bottle and a tray. \nThe first week of the program was for ideation. The idea for a feeding device was among one of our first ideas. It was a difficult task to come up with problems. We knew that it was the most crucial part. We were confident of creating the solution somehow, but deciding what to solve took some amount of brainstorming.\n\nHow can it make an impact in the world or on the community?\n\nIt is an assistive dining device that comes under Rs. 5000. Existing solutions are worth 4000-5000 USD, which is approximately Rs. 3 lakhs. Our invention can make assistive dining affordable to everyone. \nIt helps people without arms to eat without feeling inferior to others. It is portable and has a non-obtrusive design. It allows people to use it wherever they go without drawing too much attention. \n\nWhat now?\n\nWe have decided to continue working on it so that it can be made more portable. We plan on making the tray foldable and designing it such that the bottle can be inserted into the folded tray. We also need to revise the design through a series of testing. After that, we wish to file a non-provisional patent application in India and USA. We also want to present our idea at other competitions and events. It will help us in refining the product further and in raising funds for it.\n\nWhat essential and/or indispensable skills Invent@IITGN taught me?\n\nInvent@IITGN immensely improved my technical skills. I gained experience in laser-cutting, 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) software like Autodesk Fusion 360 and Keyshot. It also gave me some amount of exposure to Internet of Things (IoT), as we worked on voice-enabling the device through IFTTT, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. We also learnt basic patent law and how to write a provisional patent application. We wrote our provisional patent applications ourselves. \n\nHowever, the most crucial skill that Invent@IITGN taught me was the importance of presentation. Presenting your work well is equally important as the work itself. We had four presentations before the final presentation. These helped me drastically improve my presentation skills. Invent@IITGN also taught me how things depend a lot on critical moments. If you miss those moments, all the effort and time you put in may suddenly seem a lot less compelling. \n\nWhat was the best part of it?\n\nThere is nothing I can claim to be the best part of Invent@IITGN. The entire program was filled with things that could tie for first place on the list of bests. I got to make some lifelong friends of different ages and residences. We became really good friends in six weeks. I had more fun with them in six weeks than I ever had in the past year. I got to be close friends with people who were my seniors. Talking with people from other IITs gave me new ideas and inspirations. I got to know about how events are conducted in different IITs. We all helped each other. I also got to know some of my professors closely. We talked a lot with our mentors - Prof. Alan Wolf, Prof. Eric Lima, Prof. Nithin V. George, Prof. Madhu Vadali and Prof. Vineet Vashista. \nThe first two days of the program were for learning the basics of laser-cutting and 3D printing. We made a wall-mounted Wonderstructs structure on the first day in the room allotted for the program. We also made a table-top Rube-Goldberg Machine (Here’s the link: https://www.facebook.com/invent.iitgn/videos/2400797743485497/). We had a lot of fun together. We had a paint-ball fight on a Sunday and a networking dinner with the professors, guest evaluators and donors. It was a wholesome experience.",

				"post_description": "Why did I choose Invent@IITGN?\n\nBeing interested in technical projects, Invent@IITGN was one of the best opportunities I could have got. It provided me with a platform to work with peers across different IITs and also helped me in an all-round personality development. It was not only a great place to work but also to have fun at the same time. By the end of six weeks, we were asked to file both an Indian and a US Provisional Patent Application from the work we do in the meantime. \n\nI wanted to invent something that would help society! \nI wanted to see the world from a different perspective!\n\nWhat did I try to invent?\n\nInitially, Souritra and I had many ideas which we wanted to build on, but at the back of our mind, we always wanted to go for something that would be helpful to others. After brainstorming for around a week and a half, we drafted a problem statement. Prof. Alan Wolf and Prof. Eric Lima helped us a lot during this problem drafting period. \n\nSouritra and I decided to Invent a Smart Visor, a  device for automobile drivers, to prevent them from being blind due to a direct or prompt sight of the sun. The device includes a housing which in turn includes a camera, two motors, and a microcontroller. The housing sits on top of the car’s dashboard, close to the windshield and laterally centred on the windshield. A telescopic arm protrudes from the housing, extends vertically upwards and terminates in a circular neutral density filter of a particular size. This size is kept such that it’s just appropriate to block intense sunlight directed to the driver’s eyes. The microcontroller processes the camera’s output and uses this data to determine the motions of the motor. This aids to place the filter at an optimum position for the driver’s comfort. The motors cause the telescopic arm both to rotate like a windshield wiper and extend and retract so as to put the filter at the best position.\n\nHow can it make an impact?\n\nThe target audience of our product is people with light coloured eyes in mid-latitude countries. Sun rises at a lower altitude in these countries making the traditional sun visors ineffective. This is a serious problem for people with light coloured eyes who are extremely sensitive to the sun’s sight. Direct sunlight may completely overwhelm them which may lead to catastrophes\n\nWhat now?\n\nWe are planning to make it more compact and more user-friendly. Making it cheaper might render the product more accessible to a wider audience, especially in the west. We shall try to commercialize and market it on social media platforms.\n\nWhat essential and/or indispensable skills Invent@IITGN taught me?\n\nInvent @ IITGN taught me presentation skills, which is a very important skill for becoming an entrepreneur. We learnt how to pitch our idea to the guest evaluators. These evaluators are generally prominent industrialists. I also learnt teamwork, time management and many more skills in both technical and non-technical domains.\n\nWhat was the best part of it?\n\nInvent@IITGN provided me with an opportunity to work with peers from other IITs, which was the best part of it.\n\nThe network we made by meeting different guest evaluators every week, and the communication with the experts on the final day of judgement was one of the best things about being a part of Invent@IITGN. We also filed an Indian Provisional Patent and a US provisional Patent which I think itself is a huge achievement.\n\nWithout the help of Prof. Alan Wolf, Prof Eric, Prof. Madhu Vadali, Prof. Nitin George and Prof. Vineet Vashist, it wouldn’t have been possible to achieve such a great thing in such a short duration.\n\n",

				"post_description": "When I first got the news that I’d been accepted into the summer internship program at JAIST in Japan, I wasn’t overjoyed. I knew that I’d get to learn a lot by working with the Maezono group and that I was really lucky to get a chance to go abroad, but I just didn’t want to go to Japan. I’d heard that the food was terrible, communication was difficult as people don’t understand English, and that a culture of over-work kills people every day.\n\nTwo months in Japan completely changed my perception.\n\nThe food was delicious – even cafeteria food was amazing. (Disclaimer: I’m not a vegetarian). I developed a taste for bento and sushi and learned how to eat using chopsticks. Sure, people didn’t understand more than a few words of English, but they were very friendly, polite and extremely helpful, and most importantly, willing to put in efforts to communicate. The lab I worked in had no strict rules about time – I could come and go whenever I wanted to – as long as I got my work done. We weren’t expected to come on weekends and holidays. Getting around was easy; public transport was reliable and safe. And there was always something exciting to do every weekend!\n\nJAIST is located in a small town called Nomi, around 20 kilometers away from the city of Kanazawa – known for the famous Kenrokuen gardens. It’s a really quiet place, surrounded by gentle hills and forests. You can grab a bike and explore the countryside (I did) – just beware of the bears and wild boars!\n\nI worked on benchmarking performance of accelerated Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on a high-bandwidth HPC cluster. DFT is a technique used for ab-initio electronic structure calculations. Force constants obtained from DFT can be used for lattice dynamics (phonon) calculations.\n\nFirst, I learned about the basics of DFT. I learned how to perform electronic structure calculations using Quantum Espresso and phonon calculations using Phonopy. Next, I chose my project, and figured out a work plan with my co-mentor, a graduate student from China. I worked on scaling up a cluster, and setting it up with HPC network fabric. From then onwards, I performed various test calculations, varying different parameters and parallelization options, and profiling performance – in the search for good benchmarks. The calculations were big and time consuming, running for hours at a stretch. I got correct results only towards the end of my internship.\n\nWeekends were always fun. After working 5 days a week, my friends and I found out great ways to unwind. We explored the nearby city of Komatsu on cycle, spent a day by the seashore, visited many shinto shrines and a beautiful sky park in Tsurugi, and trekked to a nearby waterfall. We explored Kanazawa, spending time at the beautiful Kenrokuen gardens and the majestic Kanazawa castle. We learned about kutani ceramic-making through a guided tour, and learned how to paint them.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most, however, were trips to Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo.\n\nKyoto – the former imperial capital of Japan for one thousand years – has many historical sites to explore. We went to the Arashiyama bamboo forest, the Kinkaku-ji temple, Kiyomizu-dera, the Imperial Palace, and to Fushimi-Inari Taisha.\n\nDotonbori – famous for its bright neon lights and delicious okonomiyaki and takoyaki – was the highlight of our stay in Osaka.\n\nWe travelled from Kanazawa to Tokyo by the Shinkansen (Japan’s famous high speed railway). There was a lot to see in Tokyo. We went up to floor 350 of the Tokyo Skytree (the world’s second-tallest man-made structure). We explored Akihabara (famous for Manga and electronics), Shinjuku (famous for night-life), Roppongi, Shibuya, and Asakusa. We stayed in a capsule hotel – a novel experience I’ll never forget. We got around using Tokyo’s infamously punctual (and crowded) Metro, and walked from our Airbnb apartment to Tokyo Tower and back in the wee hours of the night.\n\nDuring the last two weeks of my stay, I got an opportunity to teach at the Sakura workshop. I took hands-on sessions on shell scripting, networking, and parallel Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and DFT calculations. Undergraduates from Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and India attended the workshop. I spent time with them – and made friends. We ate sushi together and explored the streets of Kanazawa over the weekend.\n\nI learned a lot during my internship. While preparing for it, I learned parallel programming, and realized that it’s challenging and fun. At JAIST, I realized that modelling and simulation and solid-state physics can be very interesting. After I got back, I decided to further explore related fields, and learned basic statistical mechanics, Monte-Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations through a project, and wrote code too. During my winter break, I learned the basics of solid-state physics in detail, and got back to DFT to understand it better.\n\nI have realized what I want to do in the future. I wish to pursue graduate studies with research focused on condensed matter modelling and simulation. I now have a much clearer idea of my goals, and what I need to study to achieve them.\n\nThe best part is - I had lots of fun!\n\nTwo months before the day I left Japan, I didn’t want to go there.\n\nNow, I can’t wait for the chance to go again.",

				"post_description": "After the end of a busy 2015, it was a start to new year with ambitious desires and lots of expectations. It was 1st of January when I had my first interview for the internship selection at one of the foreign universities called State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo in the United States. It was going to be a tough interview as there were several of my batchmates who had better profile suited for that internship, were also going to sit in the interview. Just to give a brief idea about how they had a better profile than me, I spent my previous summers doing things not related to academics. I went for Explorer Fellowship in the summer of 2016 and did some institute building work in summer of 2015. So basically, I haven’t done any projects or some related work apart from the routine courses, which most of the other people sitting for the interview had done. The interviews were over and I was somehow convinced based on the interview that it would be difficult for me to get a foreign internship given my CGPA and profile.\n\nAs the semester progressed, the internship opportunities would be floated as and when they arrived. I knew that if I had to go on foreign internship, I had to go with the contacts of professors whom I know otherwise the chances are thin. So, I contacted Prof. Vimal Mishra, whom I knew since the start of my undergraduate career. I expressed my desire of going for an internship abroad. You might be aware that not every professor is approachable and not everyone would be ready to recommend you to their colleagues, but Prof. Mishra was not one of them. He was always ready to provide opportunities to genuine students. And I would not boast about it, but I would fall into the category of “genuine” student which is why Prof. Mishra was willing to help me.\n\nMeanwhile, there was one internship opportunity at EPFL, Switzerland floated in the institute. Three students including me sat for the interview and two students were selected of which I was not one of them. It was almost March ending and I couldn’t see more of opportunities coming. Now the only option left was Prof. Mishra. Every morning I would be seen waiting for him outside his office, to remind him that he needs to talk to his colleagues for me. This went on for almost one week. Next morning, I woke up and as usual I took my cell phone to check for notifications. To my surprise, there was an email from Prof. Mishra saying “Congrats Prakrut, you are going for an internship!”. There were six other emails in the same thread where Prof. Mishra sent my CV to his colleague Prof. Venkat Lakshmi at University of South Carolina and Prof. Lakshmi confirmed that he wanted to have me as an intern for summer of 2017.\n\nSuddenly, I was all happy and my friends and family flooded my social media accounts with wishes. All the necessary procedures for Institute, VISA process and the documentation from University of South Carolina(UofSC) was completed just on time. Unlike my other batchmates, who were going in groups of at least 2-3 people, I was all alone. Twenty-nine hours of flight journey to the States, two months of stay and again twenty-nine hours of return flight back to India, started to daunt me as I had to stay alone and manage everything. I was fortunate enough to get a room in an apartment close to the department with Indian roommates. UofSC is located in the city of Columbia which is the capital of South Carolina. Columbia is a second-tier city with quite decent transport and life gets harder for people who don’t own a car – which was the case with me.\n\nTwo days after reaching Columbia, I was still suffering from the jet lag and luckily Prof. Lakshmi gave me a week’s time to get acquainted with the place and complete the official processes with International Student office at UofSC. My first meeting with Prof. Lakshmi was after roughly two weeks from the time I reached there. Venkat Lakshmi, a man with a smiling face all the time – Each person in the building would know that Venkat (as he preferred to be called) is here when he was around. In the very first meeting, he told me that first thing you should do while your stay here is – Enjoy! Go to the park and work. Don’t just sit in this closed shitty rooms whole day. So that was the first impression of the American way of doing work – at least that’s what I concluded from it. While Prof. Lakshmi was away, I worked with his research group i.e. Ph.D. students and Postdoc students. Most of the things that I learned was by discussing with those people, each of whom would have their own way of working and had different research interests.\n\n‘IITian’ – This is the thing which made me feel proud out there. Those Ph.D. and postdoc students might be good at research which I will eventually be after the experience, but being an IITian, you can be good at what you want to; which is not the case with the rest of the bunch. All this boasting of IITian is because the students were not good at coding or the data analysis part and as usual IITian, I knew some basics on which I worked upon. Those students were fascinated by this and they asked me to teach them Python – one of the computer programming languages used for data analysis. I happily agreed on that. So now, my normal routine would look somewhat like this – 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM:- My own internship work; 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM:- Teaching Python to them.\n\nOne month into the internship and I was just able to finalize the topic on which I would be working on. As Prof. Lakshmi would say – “Have a clear plan on what to do and rest would be an easy task.” I worked on the topic of ‘Evolution of groundwater resources in response to pumping, land-use change and rainfall in India’. It was basically studying the patterns of changes in groundwater storage levels affected by changes in different parameters using satellite data.\n\nOverall, I am proud of what I did in those two months of the summers of 2017. I went on to continue the same work here back at IIT Gandhinagar and was able to present this work at the conference – AGU Fall Meeting which was held in New Orleans in December 2017. Thanks to the Student Travel Grant that I was awarded for presenting my work at the Fall Meeting. And of course, being a teacher of one Ph.D. and two Postdoc students was the cherry on top of it. In the end, it was all possible because of Prof. Vimal Mishra and his confidence in me. I would like to thank him from the bottom of my heart for providing me with this wonderful opportunity.",

				"post_description": "In the summer of 2017, I got an opportunity for a Summer Research Internship at Clemson University, South Carolina, USA. Clemson is a small University town with population of Forty thousand half of which are university students. Founded in 1889, the university is over hundred years old and is ranked in top public universities in the country. The university exhibits a great scale of diversity with rough composition of 30% Chinese, 25% Indian, 20% American, 15% European and 10% rest students in Graduate study programmes. The composition resembles to many other well-known US universities which points out two major things. Firstly, the need of Quality public universities having qualified faculty and world class research facilities in developing countries like India and China. And, secondly, the resistance for higher education in local American society.\n\nI was working in the department of Material Science with Prof. Olga Kuksenok on Hydrogel behaviour under EM waves for applications in Electronic appliances. I was working majorly on computer simulations with a group of six colleagues in the lab. The important difference I found in the was extreme punctuality in time and completion of assigned task compared to India. Even though I was an intern I was supposed to work for regular full-time that is eight hours a day. The people were very serious about there working time of 8 am to 4 pm and, were also keen in availing the weekly holidays for Saturday and Sunday. I was working with a diverse group consisting of Chinese, Ukrainian, English, and Indian student, hence it was informative experience for me to discuss about the educational systems in different parts of the world during our lunch time.\n\nApart from this, the one striking difference between Indian town and town in America is the infrastructure. The infrastructure includes the road and footpath conditions, town planning, the quality of houses and the availability of well-known clothing brands and food-chains in and around the town. Another noticeable thing is the number of car owners even in small town like Clemson. On an average over 90% of local families own at least one four-wheeler and over 70% of native undergraduates owns their own vehicle which is very different from situation in India. Other than the cheap availability of vehicle and fuel in USA, the structural design of supermarkets like Walmart and drive-in facility at food chains like MacDonald’s makes it very comfortable for car owners to fulfil there daily needs. With the limited local transport facility by government shuttles in the towns other than Metropolitans, a personal vehicle has been an integral part of the lifestyle of Americans. In general people found to be more health conscious (or one could say Calorie conscious) which I think because of two main reasons. One is the development of country which brought awareness and the other is the American food which largely contains Bread, Sugar, and Meat which forces people to keep track of calorie intake.\n\nUnlike many Asian countries, the labour cost in America is very high which has made people perform their daily tasks on their own instead of being dependent on some maid. People easily do the tasks like Plumbing, fixing a car or building a small component in their house which sometimes come from individuals interest but more often it is driven by the economic need. As mentioned earlier regarding the availability of infrastructure in small towns, this has impacted on the need of youth (or general people) to rush towards metropolitan cities. This lower rate of migration really helps in controlling the demand of resources in big cities and indeed helps in developing local economy as the local talent works in the locality. This is one of the major issues in developing countries like India and China who also suffer from there huge population and unavailability of infrastructure.\n\nGeographically South Carolina is part of the southern states in USA which are assumed to be conservative than the other parts of the country. The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average in this part of the country1. During my short experience of three months, I met with few of my local friends in the neighborhood who regularly used to volunteer for Sunday prayers and schools in the Baptist church which fits with the impression of Southerners. Given all of these, I found the people to be helping and social since we had few Potlucks and weekend trips with the neighbors. Hence, to conclude, one can see the difference between the economic condition and social school of thoughts for people in developed and developing countries.",

It was a small town but it was very beautiful and offered a perfect environment for doing research. It was heavily student centric since about 25% of the population were students. Personally I did not face any problems in adjusting to life over there since everything was very well organised. The public transport was excellent and even the Mensas were very well placed across the city. Everything was very easily accessible and there were no problems with travel within the city.\n\nI was initially worried about going to a country which spoke a completely different language and had a different culture than what I was brought up in. However, I found out that there was no need to worry. The people I was working with were very warm and welcoming. There was no such language barrier that I had imagined since everyone spoke English. Of course, outside of work I did face some issues with communicating with other people, but they were not so serious. I got my city registration work done without any problems and day to day activities such as shopping, eating out etc. were also not a problem.\n\nI also travelled quite a lot and I felt that this experience gave me a lot of confidence in terms of being able to live anywhere on my own. I felt that I matured a lot during this internship since for the first time in my life I had to cook for myself and manage my money. Meeting different people was also a great experience and I really appreciated the cultural diversity that I could find in Germany. I was able to make a lot of new friends and learn about different cultures and places.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience and I feel that being in a different lab environment really helped me strengthen my knowledge in my field of interest. My internship was very hands-on and required an equal amount of experimental and simulation based work. I felt that it really helped me understand the experimental process better since I explored both sides of the work. The lab environment was very nice in the sense that there was no stress or competition. Everybody helped each other a lot and the scientific collaboration that occurred benefited everyone. My PhD guide helped me a lot when I first started and I was able to learn a lot of new things.\n\nMy professor was quite happy with what I had accomplished in 3 months and agreed to support me in my future endeavours. He was a great person to work with and I interacted with him on a daily basis which was very productive for my internship. After doing this internship, I feel much more confident in pursuing a career in research.",
