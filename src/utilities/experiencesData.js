        info: "After completing the eighth semester, I turned my focus toward full-time research apprenticeship in one of the research groups of the institute. Led by Dr Amit Arora, the Advanced Materials Processing Research Group deals with theory, fabrication and characterization of solid-state welding processes. Research ambiance and scientific temper of this group, along with a liberal yet extremely accountable assistance and mentorship inherent in the group proved to be the just the right mix of qualities I needed. Blended with persistence, hard work and honesty, it is my belief that one can make appropriate choices his/her (or their) career as I did and could get outcomes he/she (or they) desire. Today, being a graduate research assistant at Virginia Tech, I am working on modelling of friction-stirred microstructure, making a plan for characterization of precipitate evolution, exposing the dynamics of martensitic transformation to be utilized in making of new-age metallic composites using friction-stirred 3D printing processes. In hindsight, I would like to think that I got the ticket to this small world from the window of AMPRG.",
