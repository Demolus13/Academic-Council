        description: "Kindly provide a comprehensive explanation of the research problems currently being addressed by you and your research group. Additionally, please elucidate how your group's research will impact individuals day-to-day lives in the future from a layman's perspective. Furthermore, could you share examples of successful real-world applications where the machine learning algorithms you have developed or researched have been implemented, leveraging your expertise in Machine Learning? Our group called the sustainability group, works on applications pertaining to energy, air quality and health. We mostly work on machine learning problems with uncertainty. Here is a flavour of the kind of work we do. Air quality: A significant proportion of the Indian (and global) population is exposed to severe air pollution leading to several diseases and loss of life. We can not reduce what we can not accurately measure. However, the number of air quality measurement stations is significantly lower than the required numbers. Our work develops Bayesian machine learning methods to accurately estimate air quality at locations without any sensors. Importantly, we focus on not only providing the predicted air quality at a location but also uncertainty estimates. We then leverage this uncertainty to recommend where to install the next set of stations (also called active learning) to improve the predictive performance of our models. Health: The Apple Watch and similar wearables such as portable diabetes machines and oxygen saturation monitors have revolutionised healthcare. We look at creating similar wearables for estimating lung function and calorie count. We developed a mask-based system called SpiroMask that can accurately estimate various lung health parameters using an inexpensive system sitting at home, which earlier required a visit to a clinic. Similarly, we are presently developing a thermal camera-based system to accurately estimate calorie burn while exercising. Interestingly, this system is up to 25% more accurate than the Apple Watch. Working on such healthcare applications and building applications and machine learning models is generally hard due to the lack of participant data. We again leverage active learning to strategically recruit participants. We have found that by using our methods, we can significantly lower the effort required to recruit participants. Energy: Buildings across the world consume roughly one-third of the total energy expenditure. One way to reduce this energy is by providing occupants with feedback on their per-appliance energy usage. This has been shown to reduce energy expenditure by up to 15%. But, we can not install a sensor per appliance as it scales poorly in cost and maintenance effort. We proposed techniques to disaggregate the total energy consumption (measured at the household level using a smart meter) via machine learning into the energy consumption of constituent appliances. How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work? Being a faculty is a very rewarding experience. I have always maintained that the best way to learn is by teaching. Thus, this is one job that guarantees that one can keep improving and learning. This role gives us the opportunity to positively impact the lives of students (future leaders!). Being a faculty also allows us to pursue research directions that we find impactful and interesting. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends in the field of machine learning algorithms? Are there any particular conferences, journals, or online resources you find valuable and would suggest to the readers? The pace of innovation in our field and times is indeed hard to keep up to pace with. I spend dedicated time (~1-2 hours) daily morning studying some interesting machine learning talks/lectures (mostly YouTube) and then implementing them on my research blog. This helps me keep in touch with the theory and implementation aspects of these algorithms. Teaching courses and keeping the courses relevant and updated also helps me in this regard. Like other academics, I have also identified a subset of conferences in my field that I follow. To scale the learning, attending group seminars, faculty talks, and similar events is a must" ,

        description: "I, Dwip Dalal, had the incredible opportunity to engage in a machine learning internship at the esteemed University of British Columbia. Being deeply passionate about merging machine learning with neuroscience, my primary objective was to delve into unexplored territory: generating video patterns based on brain signals. To achieve this, I employed cross-modal machine learning techniques and state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, specifically the Vision Transformer. The project I embarked on involved training a model with the capability to convert brain signals into behavioural video patterns. By meticulously analysing spike train datasets obtained from mice equipped with implanted sensors, which recorded their daily activities and brain signals within a controlled environment, I aimed to predict corresponding behavioural videos. For instance, during a mouse's running activity, distinct wave patterns can be observed. This project presented an unprecedented challenge, one that had yet to be solved, and I eagerly invested three months of my time into unraveling this intricate puzzle. Significantly, I am currently on the verge of publishing an extraordinary paper showcasing the groundbreaking results of my research. Within this paper, I demonstrate my exceptional ability to extract images that accurately represent human thoughts from intricate brain signals. My work traverses various domains of machine learning, encompassing computer vision, natural language processing, cross-modal learning, and the meticulous study of single modalities within these expansive domains. Moreover, my profound fascination with mathematics has led me to explore the captivating realm of differential machine learning. The University of British Columbia stands as an illustrious institution revered for its excellence in both biology and computer science. This esteemed institution proved to be the ideal environment for conducting cutting-edge research in these fields. Immersed in a world of profound scientific exploration, I had the invaluable opportunity to engage deeply with the study of the brain, heart, and cellular organisms. The university's awe-inspiring museums presented breathtaking exhibits that showcased the inherent beauty and boundless creativity of the biological world. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to examine specimens of diverse animal species, significantly enriching my academic experience.

        description: " Q. Can you please explain elaborately the research problems currently being addressed by you and your group? Looking from Lyman's perspective, how will your group's research effect a person's day to day life in the future? How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work? Whenever I think of the trajectory of cutting-edge Materials research, I am reminded of the famous motto of the Olympics, “Citius, Altius, Fortius” that encourages Olympians to aim for faster, higher and stronger performance. Materials development has been one of the best yardsticks of technological progress attested to by the naming of civilizational ages starting from the prehistoric stone age times, to bronze, iron, steel ages, and what we now call the silicon age. If one observes keenly, one can easily perceive that we have always tried to make our materials stronger, lighter, and simply, better in every conceivable way. Indeed, this pursuit has only progressed at breakneck speed in the 21st century, driven by a plethora of variables such as consumerism, defense and military applications, medical applications, etc., to name a few. In fact, the addition of a fourth word, “Communiter”, to the Olympics motto in 2021 that emphasizes togetherness is even more apt for Materials research - we want materials to have all the desirable properties together, or at the same time! At the Computational Molecular Engineering Group (CMEG) at IITGN, we work on advanced simulations of material structure, properties and design, with a view to understanding the complex relationships between them. These simulations make use of realistic descriptions of material interactions across various length and time scales, and when combined with appropriate input conditions and computational resources to run them on (mind you, simulating materials at the nanoscale (that is, a time scale of 1 nanosecond and a length scale of 1 nanometer may well take over several days!), yield an unprecedented level of detail that cannot be achieved through experimentation. This naturally accelerates the discovery, design and development of novel materials and is crucial for the success of programs such as the Materials Genome Initiative. I will highlight some of our ongoing projects briefly. The first is perhaps one of the oldest fields of Materials, alloy development. Here, we model novel, multi-component alloys (made up of several alloying additions) with a range of material defects and elucidate the role played by these defects on the mechanical properties of the alloy. We make use of state-of-the-art atomistic simulations and machine learning techniques to describe the interaction of the atoms and defects and to explain the mechanisms responsible for their observed properties. This has important implications for high-strength, high-toughness materials with applications in defense, aerospace and structural components. The second project looks into mechanisms of Lithium diffusion in modern Lithium ion batteries from the lens of computational materials science. To ensure optimum performance and safety of the battery, there has been an exciting push internationally to develop novel battery materials with superior properties and our group is pursuing some fundamental research in this direction. Thirdly, a focus of our group is to engineer materials that are inspired by nature, a field known as biomimetics. To give some perspective, natural materials such as spider silk, nacre (the inner lining of an oyster shell), bone, gecko’s feet, etc. have fascinating properties such as exceptional specific strength, toughness, adhesive properties and the like. We build atomistic models of these materials to understand the interplay between the structure and property that are helping us in predicting new design rules and eventually, development and deployment of these materials for various applications. Finally, being a Professor has been immensely beneficial to me personally in several respects and I am sure all faculty members share this sentiment. Working on cutting-edge research projects broadens one’s understanding of our world and gives us a lot of food for thought in this complex and intricate world that we live in. The joy of teaching is another very important aspect that cannot be put into words. Although it can definitely be daunting to keep pace with rapidly changing theories, ideas and methodologies, striking a good balance between research, teaching and other forms of service is a truly rewarding, but most importantly, a humbling experience." ,
