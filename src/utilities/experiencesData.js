        description:  "1)Please tell us a bit about yourself, your background, and your journey from IIT Gandhinagar to where you are now. Ans) I come from Thane, India. In 2018, I completed my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Gandhinagar. Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued further education at the University of Florida, where I obtained a master's degree in Chemical Engineering in 2020. During my time at the University of Florida, I engaged in three internships. The first was at a petroleum/polymers company called SABIC, and the subsequent two were at a semiconductors company named Micron. Presently, I am employed as a Research & Development engineer at Micron's headquarters in Boise, Idaho. However, I am currently stationed at Micron's Singapore site for a temporary work assignment. 2)How did your time at IIT Gandhinagar shape your values, skills, and overall outlook on life and career? Ans)I consider myself lucky to have secured an AIR of 4500-5000, which led me to IIT Gandhinagar, instead of one of the older IITs. Looking back, my time at IIT GN was undeniably the most enriching and enjoyable four years of my life. The college went above and beyond to take care of its students, providing excellent facilities such as well-furnished rooms, liberal hostel rules, and financial aid. Moreover, the institution's approach to education introduced us to a vast world beyond mere rote learning and academics, broadening our perspectives. Throughout my journey at IITGN, I witnessed remarkable transformations in many of my batchmates, who matured and grew during their time at IITGN. One of the standout features of our college was its flexibility in terms of branch change, enabling students to explore different interests and excel in various electives. Even if your AIR rank was not great, the right choice of electives and self-learning could open doors to a core CS role for a chemical engineer. My journey at IITGN was made even more exciting by the opportunities to embark on three foreign internships in the US, Japan, and Singapore. These experiences played a crucial role in shaping my desire to pursue an MS abroad. The final two years of my college life proved to be the most valuable, as I honed my leadership skills while serving as the General Secretary, AIChE president, Class Representative and Shastrath Socratic Society secretary. IIT Gandhinagar provided me with an exceptional education and a platform to grow both academically and personally. I am truly grateful for the memories and experiences that have shaped my path ahead. 3)As the General Secretary and President of Alche, could you share some of your most memorable experiences and achievements during your leadership roles? Ans) Throughout our time on the student council, one of our achievements was initiating the first-ever inter-IIT student leadership conclave. We made it a priority to be approachable and student-friendly, and I take great pride in the fact that our student council was successful in achieving that. During my tenure as AICHE president, we took a step forward by creating the inaugural prototype of Chem-E-Car, which went on to compete in various inter-college events. It was an exciting and rewarding experience to witness our efforts come to life in such a tangible way. 4)Students often struggle with choosing the right career path. How did you approach this decision? Was it a process of trial and error, or did you always know you wanted to pursue a career in your field of study? Ans) To be honest, it was all about trial and error for me. In my opinion, the primary goal should be to seek exposure and gather knowledge about various career possibilities, whether it's entrepreneurship, core jobs, finance roles, or pursuing higher studies. At this stage of my career, I am still in the early phases, and I believe it's a journey that spans several decades, allowing room for trial and error. Having a clear career path right from the start is fantastic, but even if you don't, don't worry. The early years of your career offer ample opportunities to learn, explore, and adapt. Think of it as a marathon, not a do-or-die situation. Embrace the learning process, try different paths, and make adjustments along the way. It's all part of the journey towards building a fulfilling and successful career. 5)Achieving excellent TOEFL and GRE scores must have been quite an accomplishment. Could you share some tips and strategies for achieving high scores in these exams? Ans) I enrolled in Magoosh courses and dedicated time to practicing full-length tests multiple times. In fact, I recommend considering taking the GRE/TOEFL exams during your third year of study to get a head start in the application process. However, it's important to keep in mind that GRE/TOEFL scores are primarily for gaining admission to a specific college, and their significance diminishes afterward. In the grand scheme of things, a slight difference in scores, like 315 vs. 330, won't have a significant impact. Instead, I encourage you to focus on optimizing other critical aspects of your admission package, such as strong Letters of Recommendation (LORs), well-crafted Statements of Purpose (SOPs), notable projects, and impactful internships. These elements carry substantial weight in your application and can greatly enhance your chances of admission, beyond just relying on GRE scores. 6)How did you decide to pursue a Master's degree, and why did you choose the University of Florida for your further studies?What were the major differences between the culture at IITGN and UF? Ans) Both IITGN and UF are excellent places. They both offer flexibility in terms of elective courses, internships and provide ample opportunities for engaging in extracurricular activities. In my case, I decided to attend UF primarily because I was awarded a significant scholarship, which made it a financially convenient option. During your final year, there might be a tendency among students to feel pressured to secure admission to top Ivy League colleges. However, in my personal opinion, particularly concerning pursuing a Master's degree (I cannot comment on PhDs), the disparity between attending a US rank #10 college versus a US rank #90 college won't significantly impact your long-term career prospects. Hence, I opted for UF, which is a reputable college, and the scholarship simplified the financial part, making it a more practical choice for me. 7)What opportunities did your Master's degree open up for you professionally? How did it contribute to your career growth and aspirations? Ans) During my Master's program, I was exposed to the world of semiconductors. This industry is highly specialized, and only a few developed countries possess the expertise and resources required to manufacture advanced chips. Hopefully, India will be a semiconductor powerhouse in the near future. At UF, I had access to a cleanroom facility where I had the opportunity to work on lab courses and fabricate semiconductor devices. My experience at UF played a pivotal role in opening doors for me within the semiconductor industry and our IIT alumni helped me land my foot in the door. Presently, I am actively engaged in this field and enjoying my work in this exciting and cutting-edge domain. 8)Based on your experiences and successes, what advice would you give to current students and upcoming graduates as they navigate their academic and professional journeys? Ans) Embrace your time at IITGN and seize every opportunity to enhance your soft skills. Learn the art of networking and engaging in conversations with people from diverse countries and cultures. Take inspiration from skilled individuals like Atul Singh to refine your writing abilities and excel in communication. Seek out experiences that offer valuable exposure, such as international internships, involvement in startups, engaging in research projects, and exploring a wide range of extracurricular activities.

        description: "Kindly provide a comprehensive explanation of the research problems currently being addressed by you and your research group. Additionally, please elucidate how your group's research will impact individuals day-to-day lives in the future from a layman's perspective. Furthermore, could you share examples of successful real-world applications where the machine learning algorithms you have developed or researched have been implemented, leveraging your expertise in Machine Learning? Our group called the sustainability group, works on applications pertaining to energy, air quality and health. We mostly work on machine learning problems with uncertainty. Here is a flavour of the kind of work we do. Air quality: A significant proportion of the Indian (and global) population is exposed to severe air pollution leading to several diseases and loss of life. We can not reduce what we can not accurately measure. However, the number of air quality measurement stations is significantly lower than the required numbers. Our work develops Bayesian machine learning methods to accurately estimate air quality at locations without any sensors. Importantly, we focus on not only providing the predicted air quality at a location but also uncertainty estimates. We then leverage this uncertainty to recommend where to install the next set of stations (also called active learning) to improve the predictive performance of our models. Health: The Apple Watch and similar wearables such as portable diabetes machines and oxygen saturation monitors have revolutionised healthcare. We look at creating similar wearables for estimating lung function and calorie count. We developed a mask-based system called SpiroMask that can accurately estimate various lung health parameters using an inexpensive system sitting at home, which earlier required a visit to a clinic. Similarly, we are presently developing a thermal camera-based system to accurately estimate calorie burn while exercising. Interestingly, this system is up to 25% more accurate than the Apple Watch. Working on such healthcare applications and building applications and machine learning models is generally hard due to the lack of participant data. We again leverage active learning to strategically recruit participants. We have found that by using our methods, we can significantly lower the effort required to recruit participants. Energy: Buildings across the world consume roughly one-third of the total energy expenditure. One way to reduce this energy is by providing occupants with feedback on their per-appliance energy usage. This has been shown to reduce energy expenditure by up to 15%. But, we can not install a sensor per appliance as it scales poorly in cost and maintenance effort. We proposed techniques to disaggregate the total energy consumption (measured at the household level using a smart meter) via machine learning into the energy consumption of constituent appliances. How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work? Being a faculty is a very rewarding experience. I have always maintained that the best way to learn is by teaching. Thus, this is one job that guarantees that one can keep improving and learning. This role gives us the opportunity to positively impact the lives of students (future leaders!). Being a faculty also allows us to pursue research directions that we find impactful and interesting. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends in the field of machine learning algorithms? Are there any particular conferences, journals, or online resources you find valuable and would suggest to the readers? The pace of innovation in our field and times is indeed hard to keep up to pace with. I spend dedicated time (~1-2 hours) daily morning studying some interesting machine learning talks/lectures (mostly YouTube) and then implementing them on my research blog. This helps me keep in touch with the theory and implementation aspects of these algorithms. Teaching courses and keeping the courses relevant and updated also helps me in this regard. Like other academics, I have also identified a subset of conferences in my field that I follow. To scale the learning, attending group seminars, faculty talks, and similar events is a must" ,

        description: "I, Dwip Dalal, had the incredible opportunity to engage in a machine learning internship at the esteemed University of British Columbia. Being deeply passionate about merging machine learning with neuroscience, my primary objective was to delve into unexplored territory: generating video patterns based on brain signals. To achieve this, I employed cross-modal machine learning techniques and state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, specifically the Vision Transformer. The project I embarked on involved training a model with the capability to convert brain signals into behavioural video patterns. By meticulously analysing spike train datasets obtained from mice equipped with implanted sensors, which recorded their daily activities and brain signals within a controlled environment, I aimed to predict corresponding behavioural videos. For instance, during a mouse's running activity, distinct wave patterns can be observed. This project presented an unprecedented challenge, one that had yet to be solved, and I eagerly invested three months of my time into unraveling this intricate puzzle. Significantly, I am currently on the verge of publishing an extraordinary paper showcasing the groundbreaking results of my research. Within this paper, I demonstrate my exceptional ability to extract images that accurately represent human thoughts from intricate brain signals. My work traverses various domains of machine learning, encompassing computer vision, natural language processing, cross-modal learning, and the meticulous study of single modalities within these expansive domains. Moreover, my profound fascination with mathematics has led me to explore the captivating realm of differential machine learning. The University of British Columbia stands as an illustrious institution revered for its excellence in both biology and computer science.

        description: " Q. Can you please explain elaborately the research problems currently being addressed by you and your group? Looking from Lyman's perspective, how will your group's research effect a person's day to day life in the future? How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work? Whenever I think of the trajectory of cutting-edge Materials research, I am reminded of the famous motto of the Olympics, “Citius, Altius, Fortius” that encourages Olympians to aim for faster, higher and stronger performance. Materials development has been one of the best yardsticks of technological progress attested to by the naming of civilizational ages starting from the prehistoric stone age times, to bronze, iron, steel ages, and what we now call the silicon age. If one observes keenly, one can easily perceive that we have always tried to make our materials stronger, lighter, and simply, better in every conceivable way. Indeed, this pursuit has only progressed at breakneck speed in the 21st century, driven by a plethora of variables such as consumerism, defense and military applications, medical applications, etc., to name a few. In fact, the addition of a fourth word, “Communiter”, to the Olympics motto in 2021 that emphasizes togetherness is even more apt for Materials research - we want materials to have all the desirable properties together, or at the same time! At the Computational Molecular Engineering Group (CMEG) at IITGN, we work on advanced simulations of material structure, properties and design, with a view to understanding the complex relationships between them. These simulations make use of realistic descriptions of material interactions across various length and time scales, and when combined with appropriate input conditions and computational resources to run them on (mind you, simulating materials at the nanoscale (that is, a time scale of 1 nanosecond and a length scale of 1 nanometer may well take over several days!), yield an unprecedented level of detail that cannot be achieved through experimentation. This naturally accelerates the discovery, design and development of novel materials and is crucial for the success of programs such as the Materials Genome Initiative. I will highlight some of our ongoing projects briefly. The first is perhaps one of the oldest fields of Materials, alloy development. Here, we model novel, multi-component alloys (made up of several alloying additions) with a range of material defects and elucidate the role played by these defects on the mechanical properties of the alloy. We make use of state-of-the-art atomistic simulations and machine learning techniques to describe the interaction of the atoms and defects and to explain the mechanisms responsible for their observed properties. This has important implications for high-strength, high-toughness materials with applications in defense, aerospace and structural components. The second project looks into mechanisms of Lithium diffusion in modern Lithium ion batteries from the lens of computational materials science. To ensure optimum performance and safety of the battery, there has been an exciting push internationally to develop novel battery materials with superior properties and our group is pursuing some fundamental research in this direction. Thirdly, a focus of our group is to engineer materials that are inspired by nature, a field known as biomimetics. To give some perspective, natural materials such as spider silk, nacre (the inner lining of an oyster shell), bone, gecko’s feet, etc. have fascinating properties such as exceptional specific strength, toughness, adhesive properties and the like. We build atomistic models of these materials to understand the interplay between the structure and property that are helping us in predicting new design rules and eventually, development and deployment of these materials for various applications. Finally, being a Professor has been immensely beneficial to me personally in several respects and I am sure all faculty members share this sentiment. Working on cutting-edge research projects broadens one’s understanding of our world and gives us a lot of food for thought in this complex and intricate world that we live in. The joy of teaching is another very important aspect that cannot be put into words. Although it can definitely be daunting to keep pace with rapidly changing theories, ideas and methodologies, striking a good balance between research, teaching and other forms of service is a truly rewarding, but most importantly, a humbling experience." ,

        description: "Q. It has been often seen that undergraduate students at our institute get confused when they first hear what Biological Engineering is. The contribution made by the branch and the people working often goes unnoticed due to a lack of awareness. However, in recent times, the branch has received center stage due to the pandemic. Since you have had great experience working in biological engineering, can you elaborate on the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the manner in which students from other engineering disciplines can contribute to the field? This would help unravel the ‘cool' side of the field and help them realize what the branch actually is. Whenever you talk to an engineering student about a department of biology or life sciences, the first thing or picture that comes in their minds is the foul-smelling mouse or rats or bacteria, or some microscopes or machines, or proteins or DNA doing something with the biomolecules which no engineering student want to talk about. Especially engineering students or tech students try to avoid learning biology in schools or intermediate colleges or their interests are not aroused in their courses. And to the great surprise, at IITGN, the first course that is taught to the first year BTech students is BE101: Introduction to Life Sciences. The first question that we ask the students is “How many of you hate biology?” and almost all the students raise their hands. However, by the end of their end of BTech, many students land up taking more courses in biological sciences as well as doing minors or projects with faculties in biological engineering discipline… One of the biggest reasons of success of biological engineering department in institutes like IITs, particularly IITGN is we focus more on “Engineering the Biological Systems”. We ask multiple research questions in biology which actually involve our understanding fundamental laws of physics, chemistry and engineering. Our courses and projects involve a huge fraction of engineering and our research areas span the full spectrum of cutting-edge research domains like Genetics, Neuroscience, Computational Biology, Bionanotechnology, Structural Biology, Chemical engineering, Biomedical devices and engineering. And our motto is “We teach what we do”. All these cutting-edge areas including some tinges from allied areas are like machine learning, bioinformatics, advanced microscopy and applied biological engineering and biomedical engineering are included in a very balanced manner in the syllabus of all the courses offered by biological engineering discipline. These are in perfect sync with the fundamental scientific principles of biology where students learn right from the scratch asking simple but at the most complex questions like – what is life, is there life on other planets, what are we made up of, how biological information is saved in DNA, is DNA a computer, what are biomacromolecules, how do they work, what are cells, tissues, organs and systems in body, what are diseases and pathogens, how do they spread, what are the cures, so on and so forth. There is a perfect blend of scientific knowledge and engineering which arouses a lot of curiosity among the engineering students leading to their appreciation of life sciences at the end of their courses. In today’s times when diseases and other health hazards are right on the doorsteps, it is important that engineering students take keen interests in biological sciences and engineering and we are sure have such courses in institutes like IITs will churn out the best biomedical engineering like Robert Langer for the times to come. Some of the great challenges lying ahead where engineers will greatly contribute are genetic engineering, better healthcare, personalized medicine, climate change, agriculture and animal husbandry, robotics, biomedical devices, etc etc. To know more about our discipline and research activities, please do visit our website and labs at https://www.bio.iitgn.ac.in." ,
